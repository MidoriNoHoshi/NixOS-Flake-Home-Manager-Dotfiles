Switching away from NixOS for now after using it for the past few months. Using nix flakes with home-manager and trying to do things is such a pain in the ass that I just can't be bothered anymore. I hope that next time I come around to using NixOS, it's more polished. Bye bye for now my amazing NixOS setup.
